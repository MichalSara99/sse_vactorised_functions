Just a little library consisting of vectorised basic math functions written in Assembly x86 and calling in C++.

## List
* sin, cos (SPFP,DPFP)
* exp_fast (SPFP,DPFP)
* exp (SPFP,DPFP)

## Usage
Just started.
To see how to use this library see header files ending with _t.
I will soon describe in detail how to use this library.
